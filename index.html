     script ideas of your own. Check out the Plot Generator to create an outlandish logline to start with, or create one on your own by going straight to the Sketchpad. Inspired by
     the <a href="https://scriptmag.com/features/jeannes-tuesday-screenwriting-tip-brainstorming-techniques" target="_blank">7-Step Brainstorming Technique </a> by Script Magazine's Jeanne Veillette Bowerman, in about 2 hours you can take your logline

        <p>Think about your main character’s point of view in terms of how they perceive the obstacles 
          in front of them. Our biggest problems in life are not necessarily external, but are deep-rooted 
          in our outlook. The minds of our characters are complicated. Try looking at every scene and 
          challenging whether you’re coming at it from the right POV. As Robert McKee says, a character 
          is defined by their behavior under pressure. Think up situations that would crank up the pressure 
          and see what they do. In karate, if you’re trying to take someone down by pulling them in one 
          direction, and it doesn’t work, stop wasting your energy. Instead, flip your perspective and 
          yank them the opposite direction, and you’ll always get them flat on their back, with a lot 
          less energy expended. The same is true in storytelling.
