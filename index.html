    🎬 Plot Generator 🤔 Brainstormer 💡 Your Idea 📚 Resources
   </div>

   <!-- Welcome text -->
  
   <p>This writing tool is inspired by the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=movie+plot+generator+book&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS848US848&source=lnms&tbm=shop&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi5qrTVhYryAhWSXc0KHf7BB1IQ_AUoBHoECAEQBg&biw=1508&bih=865" target="_blank">Movie Plot Generator</a> book, and is a fun and effective way to generate 
     script ideas of your own. Check out the Plot Generator to create an outlandish logline to start with, or create one on your own by going straight to the Sketchpad. Inspired by
     the <a href="https://scriptmag.com/features/jeannes-tuesday-screenwriting-tip-brainstorming-techniques" target="_blank">7-Step Brainstorming Technique </a> by Script Magazine's Jeanne Veillette Bowerman, in about 2 hours you can take your logline
     to a fleshed-out idea, save it to your account, or save it as a PDF so you can start writing it out as a script. Happy writing! ✍️

      reading the article and/or looking into Script magazine. These seven 15-minute exercises are designed to take your pitch to a fully-formed idea.
       Once you are finished, check the bottom of the page, where you can see everything you have written and save a copy for yourself.
   Follow these prompts at your own pace, use the built-in timer if you wish, and good luck!
